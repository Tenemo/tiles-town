Puzzle game with a global scoreboard requiring you to flip all tiles to the same side. Built ages ago in jQuery as a toy project to learn JavaScript better, then rewritten in 2016-ish to learn React + Redux, more recently rewritten to TypeScript.

The backend is also open source and available [here](https://github.com/Tenemo/tiles-town-backend).
